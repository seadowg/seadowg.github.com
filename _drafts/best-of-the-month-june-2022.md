Jen's folks are hosting their mini garden festival "Walkerman" in a month or so and my siblings have decided to unveil our family Weezer cover band: Steezer. This means I've spent most of my guitar time learning stuff off the [Blue Album](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weezer_(Blue_Album)){:target="_blank"}.

I missed the mark on getting any new music out last month as I had to tweak some artwork, but that's now taken care of. I'll be releasing a new album/very long single this month (July):

I picked up a higher (than my 256kpbs MP3 I presumably had on my Creative Zen) quality of Reuben's "In Nothing We Trust" which I had on repeat throughout June:

# 🍷

A few months ago I picked up a bottle of Laherte Frères' Blanc de Blancs Brut Nature which I only got round to drinking recently. It was really something: big fresh green and artificial apple flavours, a lot of zing and some great creaminess at the end.

[@lambdabutz](https://twitter.com/lambdabutz) gave me [Stellaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellaris_(video_game)) as a gift and that's pretty much all I do now.
