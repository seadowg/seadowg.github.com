Here's my (very biased) takeaways from several talks at Google I/O 2023:

- Kotlin build scripts are now the default for Android projects.
- Google seems to be trying to add features to Android to try and placate Samsung's zest for killing apps (see [dontkillmyapp.com](https://dontkillmyapp.com){:target="_blank"}). One such change is that Foreground Services will now require a type.
- Like [last year](/2022/05/11/whats-new-in-android-2022.html){:target="_blank"} there was a lot of emphasis on better supporting larger screens and config changes (which makes a lot of sense alongside the new Pixel Fold). There's some new tooling that looks pretty helpful for making this easier such as a new resizeable emulator and new "Device API" (undocumented but discussed [here](https://io.google/2023/program/6d34f5ed-60c1-4a92-9ff9-5aa4fd561af4/){:target="_blank"}) for Espresso which they claim gives synchronous test device rotations.

And to finish, a poem:

*This is the way the world ends*<br/>
*This is the way the world ends*<br/>
*This is the way the world ends*<br/>
*Not with a bang but a cheer for dark theme.*
