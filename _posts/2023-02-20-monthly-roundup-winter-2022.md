I finished recording guitars and bass for my band's album over the last few months. We ended up redoing a bunch of vocals right before new year, so now have just one song left to do to finish off tracking and move on to post-production.

I also spent an afternoon with a friend's piano back in November when we stayed with them in London and ended up writing a small piece. I'll sort out some artwork for that and hopefully have it out on [my Bandcamp](https://lapetitemortuk.bandcamp.com/) soon.

I ended up in a bit of a screamo/melodic hardcore phase this winter, which was helped along by great new albums from Birds in Row (["Gris Klein"](https://birdsinrow.bandcamp.com/album/gris-klein)) and City of Caterpillar (["Mystic Sisters"](https://cityofcaterpillar.bandcamp.com/album/mystic-sisters)). The former is probably my favourite of the year. I'd absolutely adored Birds in Row's second album "[We Already Lost the World](https://birdsinrow.bandcamp.com/album/we-already-lost-the-world)", but this felt much more intense emotionally, especially accompanied by [this brilliant review on Sputnik Music](https://www.sputnikmusic.com/review/85730/Birds-in-Row-Gris-Klein/).

A few of my mates in Scotland had gotten in to Warhammer 40k over the pandemic and I inevitability ended up falling prey to it. It's been a lot of fun. I initially played a few wee skirmishes with a starter Space Marine set and then picked up the new Votann army box so I could play proper sized games. I'd convinced myself I wouldn't bother painting my minis, but looked what happened:
