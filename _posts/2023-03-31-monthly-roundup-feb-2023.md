Jen and I are travelling at the moment as we ended up without anywhere to live in Glasgow. January was spent in Barcelona (as I alluded to in [an earlier post](/2023/03/05/monthly-roundup-2023.html){:target="_blank"}) and February was mostly spent in California (Oakland, San Diego and LA).

I still haven't released the small piano piece that I mentioned [a while back](/2023/02/20/monthly-roundup-winter-2022.html){:target="_blank"}. I haven't been able to organize or create artwork for the release, which prompts an intriguing question: what is the significance of visual art accompanying music? There's definitely a potential essay on that subject that I have neither the motivation, skill nor inclination to write.

As I was going to be on the go and without a decent speaker setup, I switched away from using a Roon/Chromecast and vinyl based Hi-Fi setup to this:

The signal chain is:

1. Pixel 6a (running USB Audio Player PRO)
1. Apple USB-C Digital AV Multiport Adapter
1. AudioQuest Dragonfly Black
1. AKG K371

This has ended up sounding pretty fantastic. The K371s are a great pair of headphones for detailed listening and the Dragonfly Black does a much better job than the Pixel's standard USB-C to 3.5mm dongle (and I can charge at the same time as listening with the adapter). For a good (but lengthy) breakdown on why different digital audio sources can sound different, check out [this Darko Audio podcast](https://darko.audio/2022/08/expert-opinion-mark-jenkins-goes-deep-on-digital-audio/?utm_source=pocket_saves){:target="_blank"}. 

To get the actual music on my phone, I've ended up using [Autosync](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ttxapps.autosync&gl=US){:target="_blank"} with Dropbox where my music was already stored (I manage it using [beets](https://beets.io/){:target="_blank"} from my MacBook).

The biggest problem I'm running into is the lack of storage on my phone - it can only just fit my current music collection. This will be OK for a while, but when I get back to a more permanent home, I'm probably going to look at getting a dedicated Roon server (maybe one of the new M2 Mac Minis) and using [Roon Arc](https://roonlabs.com/arc){:target="_blank"} so I can pick and choose the music that's "offline" and using storage day-to-day.

I picked up one of the new M2 MacBook Pro 14s before heading off to the US, and it's been an absolute game changer for coding. A clean compile of [ODK Collect](https://github.com/getodk/collect){:target="_blank"} has gone from ~4 minutes to ~30 seconds. I ended up needing an explanation for this - I found that [this article](https://debugger.medium.com/why-is-apples-m1-chip-so-fast-3262b158cba2){:target="_blank"} helped to get to a very basic understanding.

While setting the new machine up, I gave [1Password 8's new SSH Agent](https://developer.1password.com/docs/ssh/agent){:target="_blank"} a try. It's definitely much slicker than needing to fiddle around with `ssh add -t` day to day (which I was doing). I haven't tried playing around with the extra feature of being able to sign Git commits with the SSH Agent (which I currently use GPG Suite for). Maybe I'll give that a go on the next machine.

I tried to only drink Californian wines while I was there but, as usual, all the cool Bay Area wine bars were full of the stuff I like drinking in Europe. I did manage to pick out a few gems in between the hoards of hype Beaujolais and uncertified Prosecco:

- The Victor's Spoils 2021 - [Bodkin](https://bodkinwines.com/){:target="_blank"}
- L‚ÄôAurore 2021 - Occteau
